var aboutText = ["Software Developer with a background in Robotics (WUT, 2025) and a passion for building hands-on projects in robotics, electronics, and programming. Currently working at Arthur D. Little, where I combine low-code (Outsystems) with traditional software development. I enjoy combining creative problem-solving with practical implementation — from abstract ideas to working systems. Project-based learning has always been my preferred way of developing skills, and I constantly look for ways to apply what I learn in real-world builds. In my free time, I design and prototype personal projects involving automation, control systems, and embedded development.",
"My passion for programming started back in middle school — nothing unusual at first. I began with simple C++ programs that printed Christmas trees, just because they looked cool. Then I met a great teacher who introduced me to the basics and guided me along the way. Not long after, and with his help, I discovered electronics and started experimenting with Arduino. I completely fell in love with the feeling of programming something that exists beyond the console. For a few years, I was almost certain this was exactly what I wanted to do in the future.",
"I decided to pursue a degree in Robotics, thinking I could learn programming on my own anyway. In hindsight, that was probably one of the worst decisions I’ve made. The program turned out to be heavily focused on mechanics and math — I didn’t even see a microcontroller until the fourth semester. On top of that, the workload was so intense that I almost gave up programming and building personal projects altogether. You can even notice a gap in my project history if you take a closer look at the portfolio section — studying full-time while working part-time as a software engineer left very little space for hobby-driven development. Most of the university work was theoretical, and it rarely translated into portfolio-worthy results. But hey, at least I got this piece of paper!",
"In my spare time, aside from programming, I love traveling. My main goal is to work remotely while traveling in a van. As much as I enjoy history and historical places, I prefer nature and less crowded, off-the-beaten-path locations. I’m also interested in international politics and history, which helps me better understand the world while traveling. I’m a fan of video games, especially strategy games, but a casual game of League of Legends with friends is always a good time. As for sports, I try to run at least once a week, and I enjoy activities like skiing, roller skating, and ice skating. I also love team sports like football and volleyball, where teamwork adds a whole new dimension to the experience.",
"I know this is a lot about myself (especially all the images, but I didn’t know what to put there xD), but I wanted to include everything that might be interesting for someone interested in... me... because, well, this is a website about me. Anyway, I’m trying to make this less awkward, but I don’t think it’s working. If you managed to read through all of this and would like to hear more of my stories, there’s a button in the footer to my notebook. If you have any questions or want to collaborate with me, feel free to visit the contact section."];
